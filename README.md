1. Bubble size can be changed by changing the range #s in the "random" function on line 10
2. Bubble movment can be made more vigorous by widening the range of parameters in the random functions on lines 32 and 33
3. Bubble color can be changed by altering the numbers in the functions on lines 26 and 28. Line 28 changes normal color of bubbles, line 26 changes color of bubbles when mouse is hovered over.
4. Bubble amount can be changed by altering the 3rd variable in the "for" loop on line 6. It can also be changed by changing the < to <=.
